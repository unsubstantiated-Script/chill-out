# Relaxer App -- Chill Out

**Version 1.0.0**

Code for a small Traversy Project I modified.

Tweaks:

- Tried new variables in CSS to work more with DRY, though some of these might not be necessary, I find a unified approach more scalable in CSS docs...

Challenges faced:

- None really, some small design tweaks to make it mobile friendly.
